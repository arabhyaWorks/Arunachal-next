Let me help you design the system and create the SQL schema based on the requirements. First, let's analyze and design the system architecture, then create the corresponding SQL schema.

System Design:

1. Core Entities:
- Tribes
- Categories
- Attributes
- AttributeTypes
- TribeAttributes (mapping)
- CategoryAttributes (mapping)

2. Key Concepts:
- All tribes share the same attribute structure (governed by a central configuration)
- Categories can have varying attributes
- Attributes can have different data types
- Both tribes and categories can store attributes with different data types

Let me create a detailed database schema:



Let me explain the schema and provide the SQL to create these tables:

Key aspects of this design:

1. Attribute Types and Values:
- The `attribute_types` table defines the basic types of attributes (text, media, array, etc.)
- The `attributes` table defines specific attributes that can be used
- Values are stored as JSONB to support different data structures as shown in your examples

2. Tribe Attributes:
- `tribe_attribute_config` governs which attributes are active for all tribes
- All tribes share the same attribute structure through this configuration
- New attributes can be added/removed by modifying this configuration

3. Category Attributes:
- Categories can have their own unique set of attributes
- No central configuration table for categories, allowing flexibility
- Each category can have different attributes

4. Value Storage:
- Both `tribe_attributes` and `category_attributes` use JSONB to store values
- This allows for flexible data storage matching your attribute object examples:
  - Normal text
  - Media storage arrays
  - Normal arrays with labels
  - Any other structured data

Example of how to store different attribute types:

```json
// Normal Text
{
    "type": "normalText",
    "value": "naisi tribes has origins in the ancient times",
    "metadata": {}
}

// Media Storage
{
    "type": "mediaStorage",
    "value": [
        {"type": "image", "url": "http://..."},
        {"type": "video", "url": "http://..."}
    ],
    "metadata": {}
}

// Normal Array
{
    "type": "normalArray",
    "value": {
        "label": "genre of the tribal song",
        "items": ["folk", "folklore", "religious"]
    },
    "metadata": {}
}
```

This design provides:
- Flexibility for different attribute types
- Central governance for tribe attributes
- Independent attribute management for categories
- Efficient querying and indexing
- Data integrity through referential constraints
- Support for metadata and validation rules

Would you like me to explain any specific aspect in more detail or provide example queries for common operations?
